# Contributing to STR (SoundTouch Reborn)

Thanks for considering a contribution. STR is a small project that
keeps a discontinued piece of consumer audio hardware alive, and
every model we get tested by a real user makes it more useful.

## Ways to help

- **Test on your speaker model.** ST10 is the reference target.
  Reports are a contribution, even just "ST20 works, presets
  survive standby cycle". Open a [Discussion][discussions] under
  Hardware, or attach to an existing thread.
- **File a bug.** Use Issues for things that are reproducibly
  broken. Use [Discussions][discussions] for questions, ideas,
  setup help, or "is this expected?".
- **Improve documentation.** README, `docs/`, FAQ on the website,
  or the German translation of any of those.
- **Send a code change.** See below.

## Before opening a code PR

1. Open a Discussion or Issue first if the change is non-trivial
   (more than a typo, more than a one-file fix). It saves both
   sides time and avoids parallel work.
2. Read [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the
   component map, tech stack, port table, and the sequence
   diagrams showing discovery, playback, marge emulation, install,
   and OTA. It is the shortest path to understanding how the
   pieces interact.
3. Read [`docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT-MODEL.md) if you are
   touching anything under `internal/autopair/`,
   `internal/tlsgen/`, `usb-stick/setup-tls.sh`, or
   `usb-stick/iptables-setup.sh`.

## Local development

Requirements: Go 1.25+, Node 20+, [Wails CLI v2][wails], `make`.
Linux is the smoothest target; macOS and Windows work but have
extra Wails toolchain dependencies.

[wails]: https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JRpersonal/streborn.git
cd streborn

# Sanity check. Both modules build natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows
# (Linux-only syscalls sit behind build tags). The speaker binary is still
# a cross-compile: GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=5, or just `make build-arm`.
# GOARM=5 (softfloat) is intentional: some early SoundTouch CPUs lack working
# VFP and a hardware-float agent SIGILLs at startup (issue #302).
go build ./...
go test ./...

# Stick agent for the speaker hardware
make build-arm

# Desktop app, dev mode with hot reload AND the embedded helpers built
# (raw `wails dev` runs with empty embed stubs: no stick formatting, no OTA)
make wails-dev
```

The website is a separate repository,
[`JRpersonal/streborn-website`](https://github.com/JRpersonal/streborn-website);
clone and run it there (`npm ci && npm run dev`).

The `desktop-app/agentbin/streborn-armv7l` and
`sticksetup/embedded/winformat.exe` files are empty stubs in the
repo. CI overwrites them with the real binaries during release.
On a developer machine `agentbin.Available()` returns `false`, and
the desktop app falls back to a configured external path.

## Code style and conventions

- **Language.** All code, comments, identifiers, commit messages,
  and PR descriptions are in English. User-facing UI strings live
  in i18n bundles. Every new key must be added to **all** bundles in
  `desktop-app/frontend/src/i18n/bundles/` (12 locales today): English and
  German written by hand, the other locales translated with the same care.
  A key that exists only in `en.json` silently falls back to English for
  everyone else, which is the gap #514 had to close repeatedly.
- **Go.** `gofmt` clean, `go vet ./...` clean, `golangci-lint`
  clean. Tests in `_test.go` next to the code they cover. Logging
  via `log/slog`.
- **Frontend.** Whatever Wails generated. Small project, no extra
  framework opinions. If you add or change a Wails-bound Go method,
  run `wails generate module` in `desktop-app/` and commit the
  `wailsjs/` changes, otherwise the frontend CI build breaks.
- **Commits.** Conventional Commits, imperative mood, present tense,
  one logical change per commit. Reference the Issue or Discussion if
  there is one: `fix(agent): preset reconcile loop on standby (#42)`.

  Format: `type(scope): summary`. Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`,
  `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`. Scope is the area
  touched (`agent`, `desktop`, `frontend`, `i18n`, `boxws`, ...). A
  breaking change adds `!` before the colon: `feat(api)!: ...`.

  **Commit subjects become the release notes.** The release pipeline
  (`cmd/relnotes`) turns the `feat` / `fix` / `perf` / breaking commits
  since the last tag into the user-facing "What's changed" list, and the
  summary after the colon is shown to end users almost verbatim. So:

  - Write the summary as a clear, user-facing statement of the change or
    benefit, not internal jargon. Good: `fix(frontend): blank station
    logos now show a generated tile`. Bad: `fix: tweak fallback chain`.
  - Do not put the version in the subject (`v0.6.17 ...`); the tag
    already carries it.
  - Use a non-user-facing type (`chore`, `ci`, `build`, `test`,
    `refactor`, `docs`, `style`) for work that should NOT appear in the
    notes; those are dropped from the changelog automatically.
  - If one squashed commit ships several user-visible changes, name the
    extras as `Release-Note: type(scope): summary` trailers in the
    commit body; each trailer is parsed like a subject and lands in the
    notes.

  See [`docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md`](docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md) for the full
  pipeline.
- **No emoji** in code, commits, or PR descriptions unless the
  change is specifically about UI emoji.

## PR checklist

Tick these in your PR description:

- [ ] `go vet ./...` and `go test ./...` pass locally, and
      `make build-arm` cross-compiles cleanly.
- [ ] If the change touches the stick agent, I have either tested
      on real hardware or noted in the PR that I have not.
- [ ] No personal data, real LAN IPs, MAC addresses, or device
      serial numbers were added.
- [ ] If a new dependency was added, it is on a current, supported
      version.
