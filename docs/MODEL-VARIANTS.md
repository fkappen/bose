# Hardware variant matrix

Per-variant fingerprint of every Bose SoundTouch box STR has been
observed running on. New rows land here as soon as a diagnostic
bundle (`box-N.json` inside the desktop app's "Save diagnostic logs"
zip, plus its `setup.log`) brings a previously unseen combination of
`moduleType`, Bose firmware version, or component layout.

No reporter identifiers (names, handles, real LAN IPs, MAC hashes,
serial hashes) appear in this file. Each row is anonymised hardware
fact only.

For the user-facing "which release asset do I download" mapping, see
[`MODELS.md`](MODELS.md).

## Reference: last official Bose firmware per model

The final firmware Bose shipped before the cloud shutdown on 2026-02. Anything older than this means the speaker missed at least one published update and may behave differently from samples captured here.

| Model | Latest Bose `softwareVersion` (SCM) | Build date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SoundTouch 10 | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | **2022-08-04** |
| SoundTouch 20 | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | **2022-08-04** |
| SoundTouch 30 | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | **2022-08-04** |
| SoundTouch Portable | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | **2022-08-04** |

## SoundTouch 20

| `moduleType` | SCM `softwareVersion` | Build year | Latest official? | `variant` | `variantMode` | Components present | WLAN interfaces | `countryCode` / `regionCode` samples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sm2` | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | 2022 | **yes** | `spotty` | `normal` | SCM, PackagedProduct | `wlan0`, `wlan1` | `GB` / `GB` |
| `scm` | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | 2022 | **yes** | `spotty` | `normal` | SCM, PackagedProduct, **Lightswitch**, **SMSC** | varies (ethernet-only observed) | `EU` / `` (empty) |
| `sm2` | `27.0.3.46298.4608935` | pre-2022 | **no (outdated)** | `spotty` | (unknown) | (unknown - box offline in every bundle) | (unknown) | (unknown) |

- Row 3 (2026-07-22 mail bundle): the first live SM2-ST20 on a firmware
  OLDER than the final 2022 build - the installer's `install_str` log
  flagged it `outdated=true`. The box flapped offline in ~1-minute cycles
  (established-TCP resets on `:8888` and `:17008`, SSH dead), so every
  diagnostic export came back without on-box data and components/WLAN
  remain unobserved. Treat reports from 27.0.3 boxes with care: this
  firmware predates every behavior sample in this matrix, and the network
  instability itself is unexplained (candidate confound: the old firmware).

### Critical differences (what actually changes STR's code path)

1. **`moduleType=sm2` vs `scm`** — wireless module generation. Same `type="SoundTouch 20"` label hides the split. Check this first.
2. **WLAN interface presence varies on `scm`** — a `scm` box can boot with **no `wlan0`/`wlan1` at all** (only `eth0 lo usb0`). Every WLAN-provisioning approach on the stick is wasted effort against such a box; STR must fall back to ethernet-only mode. `sm2` boxes consistently expose both `wlan0` and `wlan1`.
3. **Extra components on `scm`** — `Lightswitch` (LED ring / touch panel, empty serial) and `SMSC` (Microchip SMSC2014 USB-Ethernet bridge IC with its own firmware string `I<imageDate>; B<buildDate> <buildCode> <imageID>`, image 2014-10-20, build 2013-06-11). STR does not talk to either directly today, but their presence is the cleanest indicator of the older hardware revision.
4. **`regionCode` may be empty on EU `scm` samples** — Bose did not populate the field on newer EU shipments. Any STR code path that reads `regionCode` must fall back to `countryCode`, and ultimately to STR's own `region.txt`.
5. **`margeAccountUUID` populated vs empty** — populated means the box has at least once been paired against a marge endpoint (Bose's, or STR's stub). Empty means jungfräulich / post-factory-reset / never reached the pair flow.
6. **`margeURL` state** — `https://streaming.bose.com` is the Bose factory default; STR's autopair flow rewrites it to `http://no-streaming.bose.com` via `setMargeAccount` + the marge stub's `adddeviceresponse`. The field is a reliable post-install truth-check for "did pairing actually land".

### Common to both ST20 variants

- Bose `/etc/version`: `201507061523`
- Kernel: `Linux spotty 3.14.43+ #137 Wed Oct 25 21:06:53 EDT 2017 armv7l`
- `MemTotal`: ~122 MB (`122 484 kB`)
- Last Bose firmware build epoch: 2022-08-04 (the final SoundTouch firmware before Bose cloud shutdown on 2026-02)
- `networkInfo` emits two entries (SCM + SMSC) with separate MACs but the same Layer-3 IP. The speaker bridges internally; STR sees one address per box.
- Root `/etc` is read-only (ubifs `ro,relatime`); `/mnt/nv` is read-write (ubifs `rw,relatime`); `/tmp` is tmpfs.


### Variant-specific notes

**`sm2`** — newer wireless module.
- `wlan0` and `wlan1` always present in the kernel interface list.

**`scm`** — older SMSC2014-based hardware.
- SMSC component has its own `softwareVersion` of the form `I<imageDate>; B<buildDate> <buildCode> <imageID>`, e.g. `I2014102015199423; B201306111041 081008C 15199423`. The "SMSC" name refers to the Microchip SMSC2014 USB-to-Ethernet bridge IC. Image date 2014-10-20, build date 2013-06-11.
- The `Lightswitch` component is also present with an empty serial; this is the touch-panel / LED-ring controller.
- WLAN interface presence is **not** guaranteed. At least one observed scm box exposes `eth0 lo usb0` only and no `wlan0`/`wlan1` at all, locking the speaker into ethernet-only mode.

## SoundTouch 10

| `moduleType` | SCM `softwareVersion` | Build year | Latest official? | `variant` | `variantMode` | Components present | `networkInfo` entries | WLAN interfaces | `countryCode` / `regionCode` samples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sm2` | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | 2022 | **yes** | `rhino` | `normal` | SCM, PackagedProduct | 1 (SCM only) | `wlan0`, `wlan1` | `GB` / `GB` |
| `sm2` | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | 2022 | **yes** | `rhino` | `normal` | SCM, PackagedProduct | **2 (SCM + SMSC)** | `wlan0`, `wlan1` | `GB` / `GB` |

- Kernel: `Linux rhino 3.14.43+ #137 Wed Oct 25 21:06:53 EDT 2017 armv7l` (same kernel as ST20/ST30).
- Row 1: reference target, confirmed from #123 box-1 (2026-06-10). Permissive chipset: STR's `:8888` is reached directly once the iptables INPUT ACCEPT rule opens it; `is_series_one=0`, no REDIRECT needed.

### Critical difference: the SMSC-bridge `rhino` (2026-06-17 mail bundle)

Row 2 is a SoundTouch 10 that is **byte-for-byte identical** to the reference `rhino` in `moduleType` (`sm2`), `variant` (`rhino`), components (`SCM, PackagedProduct`) **and** WLAN interfaces (`wlan0` + `wlan1`). The **only** distinguishing fingerprint is a **second `networkInfo` entry with `type="SMSC"`** (the Microchip SMSC2014 USB-Ethernet bridge, same IC as the older `scm` ST20).

That bridge whitelists external TCP to Bose-binary-bound listeners only, so the symptom is:

- the agent binds `:8888` fine (`webui: ListenTCP succeeded`),
- but the box's **own self-probe to its LAN IP fails** (`self-probe: connect failed target=webui addr=<lanip>:8888`), and the desktop app cannot reach `:8888` either, so the box never classifies as STR (`strHits` short by one).

Because `moduleType=sm2` (not `scm`) and a `wlan0` interface exists, **neither** `detect_series_one` **nor** `BCO_MODE` fired, so pre-v0.8.1 the `:17008` PREROUTING REDIRECT was skipped and the box was unreachable. **Fixed v0.8.1:** `run.sh` now also sets `REDIRECT_ELIGIBLE` when `/info` contains the `SMSC` marker, installing the harmless, additive `:17008 -> :8888` REDIRECT so the desktop app finds the box on `:17008`. The narrow `IS_SERIES_ONE` gate (which also controls the boot-hang-prone LD_PRELOAD shim) is deliberately **not** widened.

> Lesson for the matrix: `moduleType` + `variant` + `components` + WLAN topology can all be identical between a permissive box and a chipset-whitelisted one. The presence of the **`SMSC` networkInfo entry** is the reliable discriminator for "chipset blocks STR's own ports, needs the REDIRECT". Likely also explains a `sm2` box that drops out of a multi-room group because its `:8888` is unreachable.

## SoundTouch 30

Confirmed from a diagnostic bundle (2026-06-10, #123 box-0):

| `moduleType` | SCM `softwareVersion` | Build year | Latest official? | `variant` | `variantMode` | Components present | WLAN interfaces | `countryCode` / `regionCode` samples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sm2` | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | 2022 | **yes** | `mojo` | `normal` | SCM, PackagedProduct | `wlan0`, `wlan1` | `GB` / `GB` |
| `scm` | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | 2022 | **yes** | `mojo` | `normal` | (per boseInfoXml; SMSC-class chassis) | (unrecorded) | (unrecorded) |

- Kernel: `Linux mojo 3.14.43+ #137 Wed Oct 25 21:06:53 EDT 2017 armv7l` (same kernel as ST10/ST20).
- Row 1 (`sm2`): `is_series_one=0`: like the ST10 (`rhino`), this ST30 (`mojo`) is **not** chipset-whitelisted. STR's `:8888` is reached directly once the iptables INPUT ACCEPT rule opens it; the LD_PRELOAD SoftwareUpdate shim is unnecessary and is skipped for `sm2` chassis (the `.so` cannot even load on `mojo`). See `usb-stick/run.sh` `shim_stage_wrapper`.
- Row 2 (`scm`, 2026-07-22 mail bundle): the ST30 ALSO ships as an `scm`
  chassis - the agent installed the `:17008 -> :8888` PREROUTING REDIRECT
  on it (rule packet counters confirmed live traffic), i.e. this variant
  takes the whitelisted-chassis path like the `scm` ST20 and the Portable.
  The architecture sketch's "ST30 = sm2, reached directly" grouping holds
  only for row 1; always check `moduleType` before assuming the port path.

## SoundTouch Portable

Confirmed from a 2026-07-22 mail bundle:

| `moduleType` | SCM `softwareVersion` | Build year | Latest official? | `variant` | `variantMode` | `countryCode` samples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scm` | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | 2022 | **yes** | `taigan` | `normal` | `US` |

- Whitelisted chassis: reached via the `:17008 -> :8888` REDIRECT, matching
  the long-standing `taigan` handling in `usb-stick/run.sh`.
- This also settles the reference table above: the Portable's final Bose
  firmware is the same 2022-08-04 `27.0.6.46330.5043500` build as the other
  models.

## Wave SoundTouch (Series III and IV)

Observed live in a 2026-07-04 diagnostic bundle (#182): `moduleType=sm2`,
`variant=lisa`, `variantMode=NoAP`, SCM firmware 27.0.6.46330.5043500 (the
same final build as every supported model) plus a `PackagedProduct`
component (04.04.08) and an SCM + SMSC dual-MAC `networkInfo`. This
supersedes the earlier "likely different CPU" assumption: the module IS an
`sm2`, so the ARMv7l GOARM=5 agent binary executes. The stick-free
`:17000` network install (v0.9.0+) is the validated first-install route:
the maintainer and two independent #182 users installed end to end
(2026-07-09 and 2026-07-11), with presets, NAS/DLNA playback, and ST20
grouping working, and the IR remote's preset keys 1-6 recalling STR
presets under the SoundTouch source. The Wave never reads a USB stick at
boot, so the network install is the only path. See the `lisa` table below.

A second Wave fingerprint (2026-07-22 mail bundle) reports
`moduleType=scm`, `variant=lisa`, `variantMode=normal`, the same final SCM
firmware 27.0.6.46330.5043500, `PackagedProduct` 04.04.08 and an SCM +
SMSC dual `networkInfo` - i.e. the Wave, like the ST20 and ST30, exists in
both an `sm2` and an `scm` chassis generation. The `scm` Wave takes the
`:17008` REDIRECT path.

Generations seen so far: the #182 reports are Wave **Series IV** units,
and a Wave **Series III** owner reported a successful install and preset
storage in discussion #508 (its playback issue was the box-side preset
refusal family, not a chassis incompatibility). Both generations present
the same `lisa` fingerprint to STR, which is why the model table lists
"Series III and IV" and the agent makes no distinction between them.

## Lifestyle (SoundTouch console)

Two variants observed. STR is confirmed RUNNING on both (2026-08-03):

| `type` | `moduleType` | SCM `softwareVersion` | `variant` | Components present | `networkInfo` entries | `countryCode` / `regionCode` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Lifestyle` | `sm2` | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | `bardeen` | SCM, PackagedProduct (`1.16.7.5043495`) | 2 (SCM + SMSC) | `GB` / `GB` |
| `Lifestyle` | `scm` | `27.0.6.46330.5043500` | `lisa` | SCM, PackagedProduct, Lightswitch, SMSC | 2 (SCM + SMSC) | (mixed) |

- The bundle also showed a stale `margeURL` pointing at a LAN host that no
  longer exists (a previous STR/mod install on another machine), with an
  empty `margeAccountUUID` - a setup probe against such a console should
  expect leftover cloud config from earlier experiments.
- STR runs on both variants. Confirmed 2026-08-03 from v0.9.28 diagnostics of
  two independent owners (`lisa` and `bardeen`), each with the agent up, the
  engine present and presets registered, plus a third owner reporting a
  Lifestyle 535 with a SoundTouch 20 Series II adapter working. An earlier
  answer that Lifestyle consoles and adapters were unsupported was wrong and
  has been corrected in `docs/MODELS.md`.

## SoundTouch Wireless Link Adapter

One variant observed, both units in the same fleet. STR is confirmed RUNNING
(2026-08-08):

| `type` | `moduleType` | SCM `softwareVersion` | `variant` | `variantMode` | Components present | `networkInfo` entries | `countryCode` / `regionCode` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SoundTouch Wireless Link Adapter` | `sm2` | `27.0.6.46330.5043500 epdbuild.trunk.hepdswbld04.2022-08-04T11:20:29` | `binky` | `normal` | SCM, PackagedProduct | 2 (SCM + SMSC) | `GB` / `GB` |

- `binky` is a variant codename this project had not seen before 2026-08-08.
  It is on the LATEST official firmware, so nothing here needs the outdated
  path.
- Two `networkInfo` entries (SCM + SMSC) while `moduleType` is `sm2`: the same
  shape as the `bardeen` Lifestyle console, NOT the `scm` chassis. Both units
  answered on `:8888` directly, with `:17008` never needed, so it takes the
  sm2 code path despite carrying an SMSC interface. Do not assume the SMSC
  entry alone implies the `:17008` REDIRECT.
- The adapter has no speaker of its own. From STR it is an ordinary SoundTouch
  speaker: agent up, `boxHealth: ok`, Spotify engine present, and both units
  joined a native multiroom group as followers under a SoundTouch Portable
  master, each verified individually.

## How to read a new bundle

The relevant fields are inside each `box-N.json` under `boseInfoXml`. Decode the XML and extract:

- `<type>` — Bose model name
- `<moduleType>` — hardware revision (`sm2`, `scm`, ...)
- `<variant>` and `<variantMode>` — Bose-internal variant markers
- `<components>` list — component categories and each component's `<softwareVersion>` and `<serialNumber>` (anonymised)
- `<networkInfo>` block count — SCM-only vs. SCM + SMSC
- `<countryCode>` and `<regionCode>`
- `<margeURL>` — `streaming.bose.com` (no STR redirect active) or `no-streaming.bose.com` (STR `internal/hosts` hijack landed)

When the agent is up on `:8888`, the matching `setup.log` (in `debugState.setup_log`, or via the SSH fallback in `pullSSHFallback`) carries:

- `interfaces:` line listing kernel-visible NICs
- `kernel:` line with full `uname -a`
- `meminfo:` line for `MemTotal`
- `bose /etc/version:` line for the deep Bose build stamp
- `bose /etc/Variant:` line for the Bose variant marker (often blank if the file is unreadable; populated on intact boxes)
- `writable:` lines for `/etc`, `/mnt/nv`, `/tmp`, `/media/sda1`

## The `lisa` variant (SA-4, Wave SoundTouch, CineMate)

Seen in the 2026-06-28 triage bundles (#273 SA-4, plus a Wave SoundTouch)
and installed end to end since:

| `moduleType` | `variant` | `type` | Components | First-install state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scm` | `lisa` | `SoundTouch SA-4` | SCM, PackagedProduct, **Lightswitch**, **SMSC** | **validated** — a user network-installed STR end to end 2026-07-09. The stick was never an option (it does not read USB at boot); the stick-free `:17000` network install is the path. |
| `scm` | `lisa` | `Wave SoundTouch` | SCM, PackagedProduct, Lightswitch, SMSC | **validated** — the agent runs via the `:17008` REDIRECT like the `scm` ST20; stick-free network install confirmed end to end (#182, 2026-07-09 and 2026-07-11). |
| `sm2` | `lisa` | `Wave SoundTouch` | SCM, PackagedProduct, SMSC | **validated** — seen 2026-07-04 (#182, `variantMode=NoAP`): the Wave ships on BOTH module types. Stick-free network install confirmed end to end (#182, 2026-07-09 and 2026-07-11: presets, NAS/DLNA playback, ST20 grouping). |
| `sm2` | `burns` | `SoundTouch SA-5` | SCM, PackagedProduct, SMSC | **validated** — an owner runs STR v0.9.25 end to end (#274, 2026-08-01): network install, app + phone-remote control and Now Playing. Known gap: the SA-5 reports three AUX inputs where STR models one (#390). |
| `sm2` | `lisa` | `CineMate 520` | SCM, PackagedProduct | **validated** — a user network-installed STR end to end 2026-07-09. The CineMate 130 is separately user-confirmed (#491, v0.9.27, 2026-08-01; full fingerprint pending from the #491 diagnostics — reports its TV/AUX input as source `LOCAL`). Other CineMate models remain untested. |

The Wave, SA-4, and CineMate 520 are now **Working** (docs/MODELS.md); the untested-model UI warning was removed in v0.9.2 (#283 follow-up). The SA-5 (`burns`) is now also user-confirmed (#274, 2026-08-01). Note: in a diagnostic a stock `scm/lisa` box shows `reachable8888=true` because that field probes **:17008**, where Bose's own SoftwareUpdate answers; the authoritative "STR present" signal is the `strDetected` field, not `reachable8888`.

## Why this matters for STR

Code paths that diverge between hardware revisions (WLAN provisioning, USB-Ethernet bridge handling, watchdog behaviour, TLS bundle generation, hosts-file bind-mount) sit on top of these facts. New failure reports get their root cause matched against this matrix before we start speculating; if a row is missing we ask for a diagnostic before promising a fix.
