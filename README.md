Bose discontinued their SoundTouch cloud service in February 2026 and switched the servers off for good on 6 May 2026. STR keeps the speakers usable: a small Go agent is installed onto the speaker itself, stands in for the discontinued cloud locally, and brings back internet radio, Spotify, your own media library, multiroom, and the hardware preset buttons. **The install runs over your home network from the desktop app**, so no USB stick and no second device are needed. The agent persists on the speaker and starts with it on every boot.

## How it works in one paragraph

The desktop app finds the speaker on the network, reaches it on its setup port and copies the agent into the speaker's persistent storage. From then on it starts automatically every time the speaker powers on. A USB stick is still supported as a fallback and recovery path, but it is no longer the normal way to install. It hosts a stand-in for the Bose cloud on the loopback interface and redirects the relevant DNS names so the speaker treats it as the real cloud. Playback then happens over UPnP AVTransport on the speaker, which is supported natively, whether the source is an internet radio station, a Spotify playlist, or a track from a media server on your own network. The hardware preset buttons are wired through the speaker's local WebSocket, so a button press recalls the saved source; the same bus lets a remote key fire a webhook to control your smart home. Several speakers can be grouped into a multiroom zone or a stereo pair.

## Screenshots

The desktop app: browse and assign presets, search internet radio, control Spotify, browse your local media library, manage speaker settings, and install STR onto a speaker over the network.

The interface is available in twelve languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, Ukrainian, Dutch, Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian, Turkish, Arabic). The full per-language screenshot set lives in [`docs/screenshots/`](docs/screenshots/) and is regenerated automatically with `npm run shoot` in `desktop-app/frontend/screenshots/`, a headless Playwright harness that mocks the backend with demo data, so no speaker is needed.

## Status (August 2026)

STR is pre-1.0. This section is the honest snapshot. No marketing.

### What works

- Discovery of speakers running STR over mDNS, list view in the desktop app. Speakers without STR show up too, marked "ready for STR", and can be installed in-app.
- Playback control: play / pause / stop / volume / bass / source switch (AUX, Bluetooth, Standby) via the speaker's existing UPnP AVTransport endpoint on port 8091. I never route audio through the dead Bose cloud.
- Radio search via radio-browser.info, queried directly by the desktop app (no API key); only the final stream URL goes to the speaker. HLS-only stations (BBC and co.) are converted on the fly by the agent's stream proxy. On a blocked or dead stream the app automatically tries another listing of the same station.
- Six preset slots, persisted by the agent on the speaker. Hardware preset buttons 1 to 6 work after install via a hook into Bose's WebSocket bus (gabbo). Existing non-STR presets (e.g. Deezer) are left untouched.
- Spotify Connect (beta): a supervised go-librespot sidecar on the speaker. Spotify playlists, albums, and tracks save to preset slots and the hardware buttons, with multi-account switching and live now-playing. The raw Ogg stream is decoded by the speaker, never by the dead cloud.
- Local media library: browse media servers on your home network over DLNA / UPnP AV (SSDP discovery, ContentDirectory browse), including FRITZ!Box, Synology, Plex and miniDLNA, and save any track as a preset. Lossless files (FLAC) play directly; the agent's stream proxy feeds the box.
- Multiroom zones and stereo pairs (beta): group several speakers to play in sync, or pair two as a left/right stereo pair. Groups persist on the speaker and reform automatically after a reboot, standby cycle, or Wi-Fi outage.
- Smart-home triggers (webhooks): turn a remote-control key, the power button, or an AUX change into a user-configured HTTP call, so a press can drive Home Assistant, ioBroker, Node-RED, or anything with an HTTP endpoint.
- OTA agent updates from the desktop app, with an SSH fallback and a pre-reboot stick refresh so the update cannot be reverted by the boot sync. Build stamp comparison catches version drift.
- WLAN reconfigure from the desktop app. I rewrite `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` in full because appending breaks Wi-Fi.
- Setup wizard for the install, including preset region, friendly name, box language, and Wi-Fi credentials. The network install is the normal path; the USB stick route (with a bundled FAT32 formatting helper) remains available as a fallback.
- Diagnostics export (anonymised), true factory reset, and a full "Uninstall STR" that returns the speaker to stock.

### In the works

- **Podcasts**: search a show, play episodes, and subscribe a show to a preset so the newest episode is one button away. Design and feedback in #215.
- **Deezer**: existing Deezer presets on the box already survive an install untouched. Reading and creating Deezer presets from STR is planned (see [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](./docs/ROADMAP.md)).
- **More streaming sources**: SoundCloud (#241), SiriusXM (#242), and Pandora (#243) are at the feasibility stage. Like Spotify, each would run through a bridge STR controls, since the speakers' built-in sources died with the cloud.

### Supported models

| Model                       | Status                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| SoundTouch 10               | ✅ Verified on hardware  |
| SoundTouch 20               | ✅ Works (contributor-confirmed) |
| SoundTouch 30               | ✅ Works (confirmed on hardware) |
| SoundTouch Portable         | ✅ Verified on hardware  |
| Wave SoundTouch series III and IV | ✅ Works (network install) |
| SoundTouch 300              | ✅ Works (network install) |
| Bose SA-4 amplifier         | ✅ Works (network install) |
| Bose SA-5 amplifier         | ✅ Works (network install) |
| CineMate 520 and 130        | ✅ Works (network install) |

Per-model detail and the variant fingerprints are in [`docs/MODELS.md`](./docs/MODELS.md). The SoundTouch 300, the SA-4 and SA-5 amplifiers, the Wave systems and the CineMate soundbars never read a USB stick at boot, so the network install is what made these models possible in the first place. If you own a model that is not listed here, I would like to hear from you so we can work out how close it is.

### What I do for security

- DNS pinning for the Bose hostnames (`streaming.bose.com`, `bmx-cloud.*`, TuneIn partner subdomain) to `127.0.0.1` via an `/etc/hosts` bind-mount. The speaker no longer makes outbound queries for these names. This closes the residual domain-squat risk if Bose lets the DNS lapse and someone re-registers it.
- Per-box local TLS CA, generated on first boot, stored in `/mnt/nv/streborn/ca/`, installed in the speaker's own trust store. Only valid for the loopback-redirected hostnames; the CA private key never leaves the speaker's NAND. The stand-in listeners themselves are LAN-reachable like the rest of the agent surface.

### What I do not do for security yet

- No client authentication on the agent's web UI (`:8888`). Any device on the LAN that can reach the speaker can edit presets and trigger playback.
- No encryption between the desktop app and the agent. Both sit on the LAN, the LAN is the trust boundary.
- No verification of the stock speaker firmware integrity.
- No sandboxing of the desktop application.

### What is inherited from stock Bose firmware (and I do not change)

- HTTP control on `:8090` and UPnP on `:8091` accept any LAN client without authentication. Standard SoundTouch behaviour, not added by me.
- The speakers ship with `root` having no password set, and SSH (port 22) is enabled by Bose's own init script when a `remote_services` file is present on a mounted USB stick. **STR does not hold that port open.** On a normal, stickless boot the speaker ends up with SSH closed; STR only force-starts `sshd` when you deliberately ask for it, by placing the marker file `/mnt/nv/streborn/enable-ssh` on the speaker. That keeps the repair channel available when an install or update leaves the agent down, without leaving a passwordless root shell on your LAN the rest of the time. While a setup stick is inserted, Bose's own gate opens SSH, which is why the app reminds you to pull the stick after setup. If you switched the marker on, the app's speaker settings show it and tell you how to switch it off again.

### Factory reset

A Bose factory reset clears only what Bose itself knows about: the Bose preset database, account, friendly name, Wi-Fi. It does not touch `/mnt/nv/streborn/`, which is where my agent binary, CA, preset store, region, name, and the `run-override.sh` hook live. After a factory reset, STR is still installed and boots automatically.

Implication: a speaker being passed on or sold needs a separate "Uninstall STR" step. That ships in the desktop app: Speaker Settings offers **Remove STR** (removes `/mnt/nv/streborn/` and the boot override, returns the speaker to stock Bose firmware) and a separate **True Factory Reset**. See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](./docs/ROADMAP.md), "Factory reset wizard", for the remaining level (reset STR data only).

### Pre-1.0 gaps I still owe before tagging 1.0

Per my own criteria in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md):

1. Two models verified end to end: met (ST10 and Portable verified, ST20 contributor-confirmed with the final stability pass pending, ST30 working on both module variants; see [`docs/MODELS.md`](./docs/MODELS.md)).
2. Hardware preset buttons need to survive cold boot, standby cycle, and Wi-Fi outage. I observe this working, but I do not yet have a regression test that pins it.
3. First-install experience: SmartScreen and Gatekeeper documentation on the website Verify page with the exact click path and a linked SHA256 plus Sigstore attestation. Partially in place, not finalised.
4. Threat model document published. Present in [`docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`](./docs/THREAT-MODEL.md). It does not yet cover the persistence-across-factory-reset point above, which I owe.
5. Legal pages on the website (imprint, privacy, both German). Some sections still contain placeholders.

Additional models beyond the 1.0 threshold, sandboxing the Wails app, and the hardening steps (token auth on `:8888`, iptables egress lockdown, automatic `passwd root` on install) I see as post-1.0. Code signing ships on both desktop platforms already: Windows binaries are Authenticode-signed with a Certum open-source certificate, and the macOS app and disk image are Developer ID signed and notarized by Apple.

## Quick start for developers

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JRpersonal/streborn.git
cd streborn

# Build the stick agent for the speaker hardware (ARMv7l)
make build-arm

# Build the desktop app with embedded helpers and version stamp
# (requires Wails v2 CLI; raw `wails build` leaves the embeds empty)
make wails-build
```

Requirements: Go 1.25 or newer, Node 20 or newer, Wails CLI v2 for the desktop app. Note: on Windows/macOS hosts the agent itself only cross-compiles (`make build-arm`); plain `go build ./...` fails on its Linux-only syscalls.

The website (st-reborn.de) lives in a separate repository, [`JRpersonal/streborn-website`](https://github.com/JRpersonal/streborn-website). A release here triggers a build there via `repository_dispatch`.

## Architecture

If you want to understand how the agent, the desktop app, and the speaker's stock firmware fit together (components, ports, data flows for discovery, playback, marge emulation, install, OTA), read [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). It is short, has diagrams, and is the right starting point for contributors.

## Repository layout

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cmd/` | Stick agent entry point, plus `winformat`, `relnotes`, `mdns-probe` helpers |
| `internal/` | Agent-only packages: marge cloud stub, BMX, UPnP, WebSocket hook, preset store, stream proxy, Spotify manager, zones, webhooks |
| `discovery/` | mDNS discovery (top level so the desktop app can import it) |
| `dlna/` | DLNA MediaServer client for the Library tab (top level) |
| `radiobrowser/` | radio-browser.info client for the app-side radio search (top level) |
| `sticksetup/` / `wifiprofiles/` | Embedded stick provisioning + saved-Wi-Fi reader (top level) |
| `usb-stick/` | Bootstrap and runtime scripts on the speaker |
| `setup/` | Legacy PowerShell wizard (superseded by the in-app stick setup) |
| `desktop-app/` | Cross-platform Wails app (own Go module) |
| `.github/` | CI and release workflows |
| `docs/` | Public documentation (architecture, threat model, models, roadmap) |

## Verifying release artifacts

Every release on GitHub Releases is built by the official workflow and ships with build provenance attestations via Sigstore. You can verify any binary with:

```bash
gh attestation verify STR-Windows-vX.Y.Z.exe --owner JRpersonal
```

Windows builds are additionally Authenticode-signed with a Certum open-source code-signing certificate; check the signature in the file's Properties > Digital Signatures tab or with `signtool verify /pa`.

For the threat model and the vulnerability reporting process see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) and [docs/THREAT-MODEL.md](./docs/THREAT-MODEL.md).

## How this repo stays clean

Every change is checked automatically and the results are public, so you do not have to take my word for any of it. The badges at the top of this page are live: green means the latest run passed, click one to open the run.

- **CI** runs `golangci-lint`, `govulncheck` (Go vulnerability scan), and the test suite on every push and pull request.
- **CodeQL** runs static security analysis on every push and weekly.
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** audits the supply-chain posture (branch protection, pinned dependencies, signed releases, token hygiene) weekly and publishes the score.
- **Dependabot** keeps Go, npm, and GitHub Actions dependencies patched; all third-party actions are pinned to a commit SHA.
- **Secret Scanning with Push Protection** blocks commits that contain a leaked credential.
- **Releases** are built only by the workflow from a signed tag, with SHA256 sums and Sigstore build-provenance attestations (above). All shipped binaries, including the small speaker shim, are compiled from source by the workflow; no opaque prebuilt binaries are committed.

Findings from Dependabot, CodeQL, and Scorecard surface in the repository's [Security tab](https://github.com/JRpersonal/streborn/security). The full policy is in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md), and hard-won notes about the stock firmware STR runs on top of are in [docs/FIRMWARE-NOTES.md](./docs/FIRMWARE-NOTES.md).

## Privacy

STR has no accounts, no ads, and no third-party trackers in the app. The speaker never contacts the Bose cloud: STR answers it locally; with Spotify Connect enabled it talks to Spotify's servers. The desktop app talks to st-reborn.de (optional version check, disablable with `STR_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`; sends only the app version, build, OS, architecture, and language), to radio-browser.info for the station search, and to public favicon endpoints for station logos. The website uses cookieless GoatCounter analytics. Full breakdown: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#telemetry-analytics-and-privacy).

It ships as a **separate binary** that STR runs as a child process and talks to over a local API/pipe; it is not linked into STR, so STR's own MIT code and the GPL-3.0 binary are merely aggregated, each under its own license. STR builds it from a small fork, [JRpersonal/go-librespot](https://github.com/JRpersonal/go-librespot) (also GPL-3.0), that adds a raw-Ogg passthrough mode; that change is offered back upstream.
