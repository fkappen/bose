// webviewDataDir returns a stable, version-independent folder for the WebView2
// user-data profile on Windows. Without it WebView2 derives the profile from the
// running executable, and because STR ships versioned executables
// (STR-Windows-vX.Y.Z.exe) every update gets a fresh profile, wiping ALL
// webview localStorage: radio favorites (str.favStations), the selected UI
// language, the last selected speaker, the radio search-country filter, the
// cached box list, and the setup region. Pinning the profile next to the
// existing durable app state (UserConfigDir/ST Reborn, where app-state.json
// already lives) keeps that state across updates. Returns "" on error so Wails
// falls back to its default path.
